## Git Repository Update

+ The Nautilus development team started with new project development. They have created different Git repositories to manage respective project's source code. One of the repositories /opt/cluster.git was created recently. The team has given us a sample index.html file that is currently present on jump host under /tmp directory. The repository has been cloned at /usr/src/kodekloudrepos on storage server in Stratos DC.
+ Copy sample index.html file from jump host to storage server under cloned repository at /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/cluster, further add/commit the file and push to the master branch.

###### Solution:
+ ```shell
  $ scp /tmp/index.html natasha@ststor01:/tmp/
  $ sshpass -p Bl@kW ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no natasha@ststor01
  $ cp /tmp/index.html /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/cluster/
  $ sudo git add *
  $ sudo git commit -m "kodekloud"
  $ sudo git push
