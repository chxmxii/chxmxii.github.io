<ul>
<li>Countinous integration is an automation process for developers, which is new code changes to an app are regularly built, tested and merged to a shared repository.</li>
<li>Countinous delivery is a solution to the problem of poor visibility and commmunication between dev and business teams. its purpose is to ensure that it takes minimal effort to deploy new code.</li>
<li>Countinous deployment means to automatically releasing a dev’s changes from the repository to produciton, where it is usable by customers.</li>

<h3 id="0--3-different-stages-">0 . 3 Different stages :</h3>
<p>CI/CD piple can be divided into four main stages :*</p>
<ol>
<li>Source</li>
<li>Build</li>
<li>Test</li>
<li>Deployment</li>
</ol>
<p>The stages are executed in a linear fashion, and each stage must be completed successfully before the next stage can begin.</p>

<p><img src="/files/cicd3.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="0--3--1-source-stage">0 . 3 . 1 Source Stage</h3>
<p>First stage of any CI/CD pipeline. In this stage the pipleline will get trigged by any change in the program. this stage will cover version controlling and tracking changes.</p>
<p>If the automated workflow detects a change in the central repository, it will trigger tasks such as code compilation and unit testing.</p>
<p><strong>Example tools :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>GIT</li>
<li>Azure Repos</li>
<li>AWS CodeCommit</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="0--3--2-build-stage-">0 . 3 . 2 Build Stage :</h3>
<ul>
<li>The second stage of the pipeline you merge the source code and its dependencies.</li>
<li>It is done mainly to build a runnable instance of software that you can potentially ship to the end-user.</li>
<li>Failure to pass the build stage could indicate a fundamental issue in the underlying code.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example tools :</p>
<ol>
<li>Jenkins</li>
<li>AWS CodeBuild</li>
<li>Azure Pipelines</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="0--3--3-test-stage-">0 . 3 . 3 Test Stage :</h3>
<p>Test stage includes the execution of automated tests written by developers (integration testing, functional testing etc..) to validate the correctness of code and the behaviour of the software.</p>
<p>The main goal of this stage is to prevent software bugs from reaching end-users.</p>
<p><strong>Example Tools :</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Puppeteer</li>
<li>Jest</li>
<li>Selenium.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="0--3--4-deploy-stage-">0 . 3 . 4 Deploy stage :</h3>
<p>Final stage of the pipeline, where your product goes live after passing the source,build and test stages successfully.</p>
<p>The deployment stage can include infra provisioning, config, and containerization using techs like terraform, puppet,docker and k8s.</p>
<p><strong>Example Tools :</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Ansible</li>
<li>Chef</li>
<li>AWS Elastic beanstalk</li>
<li>AWS Code Deploy</li>
<li>Azure Pipelines - Deployment.</li>
</ol>
